# Convert an Integer to Its Ordinal Number

Words like *first*, *second* and *third* are referred to as ordinal numbers. 

Write a function named **integer to ordinal** that: 
- takes an integer as its only parameter, between 1 and 12 (inclusive). 
- returns a string containing the appropriate English ordinal number as its only result.    

It should return an empty string if the function is called with an argument outside of this range. 

Include a main program that demonstrates your function by displaying each integer from 1 to 12 and its ordinal number.    
Your main program should only run when your file has not been imported into another program.
