# Secure Password Generator

The present project consists in the development of a secure password generator, a tool that allows users to create complex and difficult to guess passwords. The generator will capture the desired password length and provide a random password, consisting of a combination of alphanumeric characters and symbols.

## Objective:
The goal of the project is to provide users with a tool for generating secure passwords that can be used to protect online accounts, sensitive data and other personal information. 
Using variables, strings, mathematical calculations, conditional operators, loops and functions, the generator will allow users to obtain random and complex passwords quickly and reliably.

## Main features:

### Password length capture:

Ask the user to enter the desired password length and store it in a numeric variable.

### Password generation:

- Using a for loop, generate a random password of desired length.
- Use a combination of alphanumeric characters and symbols to create a strong and secure password.
- Store the generated password in a string type variable.

### Password display:

Using a function to hide the displayed password, print the generated password for the user to the screen.
