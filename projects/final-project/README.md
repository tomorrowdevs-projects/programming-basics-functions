# Simple Time Display

### Description
The goal of this project is to create a simple command-line program that displays accurate time and date information,
along with additional features like time zone conversion and countdowns.

### Requirements

**Display Current Time**   
The program should display the current time and date based on the system clock.

**Time Zone Conversion**  
Allow the user to input a specific time zone, and then display the current time in that time zone.

**Countdown Timer**   
Enable the user to set a countdown timer for a specific amount of time (in hours, minutes, and seconds) 
and display the remaining time.

**Stopwatch**  
Implement a stopwatch feature that allows the user to start, stop, and reset the timer.

**Display Date Information**   
Include additional date information such as day of the week, day of the year, and week number.

**Customizable Output**    
Allow the user to choose how they want the countdown displayed (e.g., days, hours, minutes).

**World Clock Display**   
Allow the user to add and display multiple clocks for different time zones simultaneously.


_Remember, you don't need to implement all of these features at once.   
Start with the basic functionality and gradually add more features as you become comfortable with the project._
