# Event Date Validator

### Description
Create a program that validates event dates entered by users.   
It will make use of date functions to ensure that the dates are valid and in the future.    
Additionally, the program will handle exceptions gracefully in case of incorrect input.

### Requirements

**User Input**  
The program should prompt the user to enter a date in the format (YYYY-MM-DD).

**Date Validation**   
The program should check if the entered date is a valid date (e.g., 2023-10-20 is valid, 2023-13-01 is not).
Ensure the date entered is in the future (i.e., after the current date).  

**Exception Handling**
If the user enters an invalid date or a date in the past, an appropriate error message should be displayed, 
and the user should be prompted to enter a valid date again.

**User-Friendly Interface**   
Use a while loop to allow the user to input multiple dates without restarting the program each time.

**Error Logging**
Implement a feature to log any errors encountered, including the date entered and the specific error (invalid format, past date, etc.).

**Advanced Date Functions**
Utilize date functions to calculate and display the number of days until the event.

**Timezone Support**   
Allow the user to specify a timezone for the event date and display the date in that timezone.
Reminder Functionality:

**Customizable Output**    
Allow the user to choose how they want the countdown displayed (e.g., days, hours, minutes).

_Remember, you don't need to implement all of these features at once.   
Start with the basic functionality and gradually add more features as you become comfortable with the project._
