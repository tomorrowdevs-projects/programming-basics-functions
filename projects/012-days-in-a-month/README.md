# Days in a Month

Write a function called **days in a month** that determines how many days there are in a particular month.    
Your function will take two parameters: 
- the month as an integer between 1 and 12
- the year as a four digit integer

Ensure that your function reports the correct number of days in February for leap years. 
Include a **main** program that reads a month and year from the user and displays the number of days in that month.
