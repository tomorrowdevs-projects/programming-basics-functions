# Magic Dates

A magic date is a date where the day multiplied by the month is equal to the two digit year. 
For example, June 10, 1960 is a magic date because June is the sixth month, and 6 times 10 is 60, which is equal to the two digit year. 
Write a function that determines whether or not a date is a magic date. 
Use your function to create a main program that finds and displays all of the magic dates in the 20th century.
