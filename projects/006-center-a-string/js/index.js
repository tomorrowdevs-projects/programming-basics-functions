/*
Write a function named center string that takes:

string, s, as its first parameter,
width of the window in characters, w, as its second parameter.
Your function will return a new string that includes whatever leading spaces are needed so that s will be centered in the window when the new string is printed.

The new string should be constructed in the following manner:

If the length of s is greater than or equal to the width of the window then s should be returned.
If the length of s is less than the width of the window then a string containing (len(s) - w) // 2 spaces followed by s should be returned.
Write a main program that demonstrates your function by displaying multiple strings centered in the window.

1) Come calcolare lunghezza di una stringa?

2) A quanto ammonta la larghezza del Terminal Window?

3) La funzione ritorna una stringa che deve essere centrata nella finestra

4) Se stringa >= width terminal window ----> return stringa

5) Se stringa
