# Arbitrary Base Conversions

Write a program that allows the user to convert a number from one base to another.   
Your program should support bases between 2 and 16 for both the input number and the result number. 

If the user chooses a base outside of this range then an appropriate error message 
should be displayed and the program should exit. 

Divide your program into several functions: 
- a function named **arbitrary to base 10** that converts from an arbitrary base to base 10
- a function that **base 10 to arbitrary base** converts from base 10 to an arbitrary base
- a main program that reads the bases and input number from the user
