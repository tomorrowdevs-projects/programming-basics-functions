# Password Validation

In this exercise you will write a function named **is valid password** that determines whether a password is good.   
We will define a good password to be a one that is:
- at least 8 characters long
- contains at least one uppercase letter
- contains at least one lowercase letter
- contains at least one number

Your function should return True if the password passed to it as its only parameter is good.  
Otherwise it should return False. 

Include a main program that reads a password from the user and reports whether it is good.   
Ensure that your main program only runs when your solution has not been imported into another file.
