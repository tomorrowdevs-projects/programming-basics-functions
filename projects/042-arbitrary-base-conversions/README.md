# Arbitrary Base Conversions

Write a program that allows the user to convert a number from one base to another. Your program should support bases between 2 and 16 for both the input number and the result number. If the user chooses a base outside of this range then an appropriate error message should be displayed and the program should exit. Divide your program into several functions, including a function that converts from an arbitrary base to base 10, a function that converts from base 10 to an arbitrary base, and a main program that reads the bases and input number from the user.
