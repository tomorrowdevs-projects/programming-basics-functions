# **TomorrowDevs Programming Basics Learning Path**
## **Conditionals and Iterations** 

This repository is part of the full Programming Basics Learning Path by Tomorrowdevs.

The aim of this path is to allow people to learn Programming skills by building practical projects.

## **Description**

The final purpose of this path is to allow you to build another real-world project that you can use in your life and present it as a project for your interviews.

In this case, you will build a **Secure Password Generator**, using Variables, expressions, statements, string, conditionals, iterations and functions.

In order to achieve that, you will be guided into different steps and tasks, composed by a combination of theory and coding.

Additionally, you will start to study some key concepts of Clean Code and coding best practices.
